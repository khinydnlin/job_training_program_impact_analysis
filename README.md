# Impact Evaluation of Job Training Program for Youth Employment

#### -- Project Completed

## Background

- This summary report presents the analysis and findings of an impact evaluation of a six-week training programme implemented in January 2005. The programme, initiated by the UK government in collaboration with Local Authorities (LA), aimed to provide young people with crucial job search skills, such as resume writing, application preparation, and interview techniques. The primary goal of this evaluation is to gather evidence of the programme's impact and the extent to which observed outcomes can be attributed to the initiative. It also aims to provide recommendations for policy-makers and training providers based on the findings.

The evaluation was designed to compare the outcomes of 309 LAs that delivered the training programme with 191 LAs that did not participate, serving as a comparison group. The study covers data from 500 LAs over three years: 2003, 2004, and 2005.
	
## Methodology

- Impact evaluation typically aims to compare the outcomes of an intervention with the outcomes that would have occurred in its absence. For this evaluation , a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach was employed on the longitudinal dataset to estimate the net impact of job training programme on youth employment. This method involves comparing outcomes before and after the programme's implementation, as well as between the treatment group that implemented the programme and the comparison group that did not. DiD is a widely-used method that minimises the effects of confounding factors by leveraging these double comparisons, especially when random selection of training participants is not feasible.

## Analysis

- The dataset comprises 1,500 panel data observations from 500 LAs over three years, including log-transformed population and employment data. Firstly, the data was thoroughly checked for duplicates and missing values. Additionally, new variables were created to categorise the periods into pre- and post-intervention, and to distinguish between the treatment and comparison groups, in preparation for the DiD analysis.
	
- The Parallel Trend Assumption was tested through visual inspection and pre-trend regression analysis to ensure the employment rates of the treatment and comparison groups followed similar trends before the intervention.The results showed no statistically significant difference in employment trends between the two groups (p = 0.765), as checked against the significance level of 0.05.
 
- As part of the DiD approach, a two-way fixed effects method was used to account for unobserved confounding factors. This method controls entity-specific characteristics that vary between LAs but remain constant over time, such as location or local economy. It also accounts for time-specific factors that affect all areas but change over time, such as national economic conditions. Additionally, the population variable was added as a control variable to adjust for observed factors that can vary across LAs and over time. 

- Our analysis indicates that LAs that implemented the programme saw a positive increase in youth employment compared to the comparison group. The training programme led to an estimated 4.91% increase in youth employment, as reflected by the coefficient estimate of 0.049132 (p = 0.01321).

## Findings and Recommendations

- The training programme initiated by the UK government in January 2005 demonstrated a measurable positive impact on youth employment. Young people in areas where the programme was introduced had a higher likelihood of securing employment compared to those in areas without the programme, with an increase of approximately 4.91%.

- To better understand the programme's effectiveness, it is recommended to gather feedback from participants through interviews or surveys. This will provide insights into the content, duration, and delivery of the programme. Understanding participant satisfaction and the relevance of the skills learned can help identify areas for improvement and allow for tailored training to better meet participants' needs.

- As the current data only covers one year after the intervention, it primarily reflects short-term benefits. To determine if the skills gained from the programme have lasting impacts on employability, it is advisable to conduct evaluations over multiple years. This will help assess the long-term sustainability of the programme's positive outcomes and allow for timely adjustments to address any emerging challenges.

- Lastly, to maximise the programme’s impact, consider complementing it with additional support services such as career counselling, mentorship, and apprenticeships. These services can provide ongoing guidance and support to young job seekers.

## Limitations

- The full impact of the training programme on youth employment is challenging to ascertain from the available data. The lack of additional information, such as geographical location, prevents us from conducting a comprehensive analysis to understand how the programme's impacts may vary across different sub-groups. Furthermore, due to the aggregated nature of the data, we were unable to include individual participant characteristics—such as education level and gender—in the analysis to determine whether these factors influenced the outcomes.
